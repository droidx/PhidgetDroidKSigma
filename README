This is the second version of the PhidgetDroid Android Project.

It adds the functionality of detecting picks using the Ksigma algorithm to the previous PhidgetDroid app.

So what the app does overall is :
1.Interfaces the phidget to the android tablet (In this case, it is the Motorola Xoom running 4.0.3)
2.Detects the picks
3.Plots the acceleration curves for representation
